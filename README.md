#  CYF Language Exchange site project

##  Technologies used
-  HTML
-  CSS
-  Javascript
-  Nunjucks (templating engine)
-  Gulp.js (toolkit for building, amongst other things)

##  I suggest reading / watching these first
-  [Github Issues Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/)
-  [Nunjucks Overview](https://zellwk.com/blog/nunjucks-with-gulp/)

##  How to run the project
After cloning to your machine, be sure to run 'npm install' to gain all the necessary dependencies.

To run the development script, use the command 'npm run devstart'. Head to localhost:5000 to see the development server. Nodemon wil watch for changes but will not hot reload, so be sure to refresh to view changes.

There is currently a Netlify site live which picks up pushes to the main branch. You can visit the development site at https://cyf-language-pilot.netlify.app/

Please do not push directly to the main branch! This is not good pratice. Instead, push to the dev branch and make pull requests :)

##  Who can contribute?
Anybody is welcome to join, but I do advise you have completed up until at least the end of the React module in the CYF syllabus if you want to contribute your technical skills. This is because an understanding of HTML, CSS, and Javascript is required, and I think that the concepts of React can be applied in understanding how templates allow us to 'modularize' sites (break into pieces).

##  Project aims
This project aims to create a pilot version of a site or page that we can use to better organize our language community. At the moment, we face a few issues.

-  Despite trying various methods to organize language exchanges, it is difficult to do this via Slack. Therefore, something more centralised could be more accessible and robust.
-  Some people (especially newer mentors and students) are unaware of the language exchange project. We want a place we can direct everyone to.

##  Why should I contribute?
This project uses some technologies we don't teach on the course, namely templates and a build tool, meaning you get exposure to a couple new things while working with familiar tools like HTML, CSS and Javascript.

By joining the project, you can not only improve your skills, but get some experience working with others on a version controlled project, as well as creating something that will hopefully be used by the CodeYourFuture community in the near future.

##  How can I contribute?
There are a few ways you can contribute.
-  Technical contributions: use your coding skills to solve open issues.
-  User research. Help us figure out what users want, what they like, what they don't like
-  Add content. For example, we have a page for language learning resources. Help us add more!

There are already a few issues open to get started on, but feel free to add more!
