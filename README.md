#  CYF Language Exchange site project

##  Technologies used
-  HTML
-  CSS
-  Javascript
-  Nunjucks (templating engine)
-  Gulp.js (toolkit for building, amongst other things)

##  Who can contribute?
Anybody is welcome to join, but I do advise you have completed up until at least the end of the React module in the CYF syllabus if you want to contribute your technical skills. This is because an understanding of HTML, CSS, and Javascript is required, and I think that the concepts of React can be applied in understanding how templates allow us to 'modularize' sites (break into pieces).

##  Project aims
This project aims to create a pilot version of a site or page that we can use to better organize our language community. At the moment, we face a few issues.

-  Despite trying various methods to organize language exchanges, it is difficult to do this via Slack. Therefore, something more centralised could be more accessible and robust.
-  Some people (especially newer mentors and students) are unaware of the language exchange project. We want a place we can direct everyone to.

##  Why should I contribute?
This project uses some technologies we don't teach on the course, namely templates and a build tool, meaning you get exposure to a couple new things while working with familiar tools like HTML, CSS and Javascript.

By joining the project, you can not only improve your skills, but get some experience working with others on a version controlled project, as well as creating something that will hopefully be used by the CodeYourFuture community in the near future.

##  How can I contribute?
There are a few ways you can contribute.
-  Technical contributions: use your coding skills to solve open issues.
-  User research. Help us figure out what users want, what they like, what they don't like
-  Add content. For example, we have a page for language learning resources. Help us add more!
